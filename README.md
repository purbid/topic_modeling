# topic_modeling
notebooks for topic modeling using BOW, TOP2VEC and BERTopic



These two noetbooks give various approaches to topic modeling. 
The First one shows topic modeling with BOW and LDA, followed by Top2Vec, a vector based model that uses Doc2Vec for Topic Modeling.
Results were much better with BOW LDA, with optimal number of topics 14.
